  <p>This week we where asked to design boxes using and online softwear.

  <p> Then we had to use adobe illistrator, to add some lettering and change the colors so as 
      to define the different cuts. Then we upload it onto the cutting softwear and place 
      the objects onto open spaces on the wood, and then begin the cut.

    We should also talk about the safety requirements with this machine, being that it is a lazer that is being used to 
    cut wood. There is the large factor of fire, with this danger we have both a fire blanket and a fire extinguisher right next
    to the laser cutter. With the precautions we also have the protocols to go with them, being things like turning the machine
    off keeping the air filter on and removing the flaming wood and placing it in the fire bucket(also next to the machine).
