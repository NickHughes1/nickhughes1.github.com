  <p>This week we are working with the vinyl cutter. The vinyl cutter is a form of digital fabrication, because it uses and 
      online software to control a physical machine. Much like other forms of digital fabrication. While talking about 
      vinyl cutting we should talk about the differnece between vector and raster images. Vector images are rendered by the
      computer using a mathmatical fomula. While raster images are made up of pixels making them resolution depended.

  <p> The image and text i used are both related to albert einstein, for obvius reasons he is a well known figure and i have heard
      this quote from him maltaple times. “There are two kinds of people - those who believe everything 
      is a miracle, and those who believe nothing is a miracle.” -Albert Einstein. I like the quote and thus it is now on my shirt
      as for the image it was just a fun image ive seen circulating the internet so it made a good addition.
