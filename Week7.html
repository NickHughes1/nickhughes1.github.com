  <p>The theme for this project was this class (never would have guessed would you?). In all honesty i was running low on time
      for this project so i went with something simple and sent myself off to do the embroidery. With a little trouble shooting help from Dan
      we made it through. Though that machine was not so nice to me.

  <p>  We where asked to do some design prep on paper before we began our embroidery, 
      this is what I had for mine. (fabulus artist that I am, I hope you like!)
