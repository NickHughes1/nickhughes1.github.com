  <p>This week we worked with SLA printing, SLA printing is the oposite of FDM printing as it is not an excretion based process
      but it is a hardening process. Inside a SLA printing machine there is resin that is hardened by a laser. It is basicly a
      photosensitive liquid is changed into a solid plastic layer by layer to create your 3D object.

  <p> The video that I used to design my ring was by Urza and he talked about how to make a "Spinner ring". There where many 
      posotives and some negtives to the video. Some of the positives where that he was very consise and acurate with his descriptions 
      as well as having good visuals that where easy to follow. Some of the negatives where that Urzas fusion 360 was in another language.
      which did make it a little harder to follow. along with the fact that he was very quick so I did have to rewind the video
      maltaple times.
